##### Welcome~!! I am juyeop Han.

I am a Master's student in Aerospace Engineering at KAIST, being advised by Prof. [Han-Lim Choi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5hGAWMAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao). I recieved my undergraduate degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Seoul National University.

I am currently interested in a field of Robotics, especially in 1) filling gap between theory and real-world application in robotics and multi-agent system, 2) guaranteeing safety with robotic perception and learning, and 3) Versatile robotic operation in dynamic environment.

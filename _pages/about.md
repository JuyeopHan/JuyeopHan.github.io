I am Juyeop Han, a Ph.D. student at [MIT LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/), advised by Prof. [Sertac Karaman](https://karaman.mit.edu/). I am currently interested in **(1) uncertainty quantification of neural networks** and **(2) its application to robotics**.

I recieved MS degree in Aerospace Engineering at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/) advised by Prof. [Han-Lim Choi](https://lics.kaist.ac.kr/) and BS degree in Mechanical Engineering at Seoul National University ([SNU](https://www.snu.ac.kr/)) under the supervision of Prof. [Sung-hoon Ahn](https://fab.snu.ac.kr/team/professor.php). I worked as a visiting scholar at University of Colorado Boulder ([CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/)), where I collaborated with Prof. [Zachary Sunberg](https://zachary.sunberg.net/) between October 2022 and February 2023. My research duriny my master's program lied in **(1) dynamic occupancy grid mapping with a LiDAR sensor** and **(2) Reachability analysis for agile and safe flight of a quadrotor**.

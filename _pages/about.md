I am Juyeop Han, an incoming Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/). I am the recipient of Korean Government Scholarship for Overseas Study.

I recieved MS degree in Aerospace Engineering at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/) being advised by Prof. [Han-Lim Choi](https://lics.kaist.ac.kr/) and BS degree in Mechanical Engineering at [Seoul National University (SNU)](https://www.snu.ac.kr/) under the supervision of Prof. [Sung-hoon Ahn](https://fab.snu.ac.kr/team/professor.php). I worked as a visiting scholar at [University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder)](https://www.colorado.edu/), where I collaborated with Prof. [Zachary Sunberg](https://zachary.sunberg.net/) between October 2022 and February 2023.

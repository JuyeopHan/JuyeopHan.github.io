I am pursuing M.S. degree in AE at KAIST being advised by Prof. [Han-Lim Choi](https://lics.kaist.ac.kr/) and  recieved B.S. degree in ME at Seoul National University under the supervision of Prof. [Sung-hoon Ahn](https://fab.snu.ac.kr/team/professor.php). Currently, I am a visiting scholar at Ann and H.J. Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences, CU Boulder from October 2022, being advised by Prof. [Zachary Sunberg](https://zachary.sunberg.net/).

My research interest:    
 &nbsp; 1) **Guaranteeing or Maximizing safety** in fields of robotics and machine learning    
 &nbsp; 2) **Integration theoretical and practical approaches** for real-world application in robotics    
 &nbsp; 3) General and fundamental **research applicable to various fields** such as robotics, control theory, machine learning, and optimization
